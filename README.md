# MachineLearning_Roadmap

**In this Roadmap I will try my best to walk you through the process to be a ML Engineer. you don't have to follow all the resources exactly as they are all just 
opinions,but I advise you to follow the hierarchy of the Roadmap. Courses are not enough alone you will have to read Books and practice on your own.
You are welcome to contribute to this repo ‚ù§**

# How to get the best out of this Roadmap
First fork the repo to keep track of your progress and when you complete a book or course just mark it as completed by replacing this mark:
```
- [ ]
```
by this mark with `x` inside it like this:
```
- [x]
```
if your forked version is behind my repo you will need to sync it to get the latest update and that's it.
